# ZV Portfolio Example

## Overview
I prepared a Portfolio Website Project using HTML and CSS.
With this project I aimed to understand how CSS works.

## Fake it 'till you make it.
The main source that I've looked while working on this project:

## Features
Colors are storing in variables. That makes easier to change all the same colors at the same time.
Photo in website has a hover. That makes the photo looks like it has fading effect.
Buttons on the website are color changing when mouse is brought on top of the buttons.
The website items are loading to left to right after opening the page or resetting the page. It gives a nice effect.
